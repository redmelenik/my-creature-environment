Evolutionary Algorithm using  neural nets

Ultimate goal is for a creature to evolve to a perfect point where it can procreate multiply and become the dominant species

Evolve creatures with the following 3 characteristics 
Gender (M/F)
Brain
Body
Legs

The world they live in will be an enclosed square space. They will have the ability to move forward, backwards, left and right. The creature must come into contact with a food token and it will be deemed collected. If the creature collects too many or too little of a food token the creature will evolve in an undesirable direction and eventually die. It is impossible to shed a food item once it’s collected. 

For each cycle of the process 100 Creatures are spawned as M or F in a random way. The strongest creature from every era will move the next era. Every creature will have a set of DNA, this is defined by the number of gender/head/body/legs the creature was able to collect. To evolve, the creatures need to compete for randomly created food tokens. Food tokens help create the 3 characteristics of brain, body and legs. Strength is defined as a creature which is closest to the golden ratio on brain/body/legs. Each creature needs to consume a specific ratio of the 3 food tokens. Too many of one token causes the creature to evolve too much in a certain characteristic and will not be successful. Food tokens must be collected in the following golden ratio for the creature to be considered evolved

25 brain
20 body 
16 legs 

Food tokens are prioritized with brain being the most valuable then body then legs. The creature must collect 5 brain tokens before it can start collecting body tokens. It must collect 5 body tokens before it can start collecting legs. The creature is restricted to collect 4 leg tokens for every body token collected. Once it’s collected 5 body tokens and 4 leg tokens it must collect another 5 brain tokens for the sequence to continue. 

Leg tokens are further categorized into forward, back, left, right. This controls the direction and speed the creature can move in. It has to collect 4 tokens of each to get full directional movement at full speed. 

An excess of any 3 characteristics will cause the creature to die. Limits that cause a creature to die are
30 brain
25 body
20 legs

Once a creature is considered fully evolved it will start to create a language in order to communicate and self arrange into tribes. Communication is defined as a separate characteristic called speech. Speech tokens are created when a creature touches the same creature more than 5 times. Once two creatures have touched 5 times or more they are considered part of the same tribe. Once the tribe grows it starts to become able to create structures such as houses.
